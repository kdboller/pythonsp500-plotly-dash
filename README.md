# pythonsp500-plotly-dash
This repo contains the Jupyter notebook and Python script with the full code for my "Python for Finance:  Plotly Dash" post, as well as the excel file initially read in as the sample portfolio, using pandas, and the csv files generated from the Jupyter notebook.  Using a virtual environment, Python 3.6, and the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file, you can run a Plotly Dash dashboard locally based on the csv files generated from the Jupyter notebook.

## Getting set up

1. Clone this repository:  ``git clone https://github.com/kdboller/pythonsp500-plotly-dash``; or 
2. Hit 'Clone or download' on the main repo page in order to grab the Jupyter notebook, python script and the sample excel file.

## Note on Anaconda distribution and Python Notebook

I highly recommend that you download the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  You can also run the notebook without Anaconda using ``pip`` to install the required packages, however Anaconda is the industry standard for data science.

## Python Version and Virtual Environments:  
It is recommended that you have Python 3.6 or greater so that you can run the Plotly Dashboard locally with the provided csv files.  

I strongly recommend setting up a virtual environment. I manage all of my virtual environments with Anaconda.  

[Here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-you-need-python-environments-and-how-to-manage-them-with-conda-85f155f4353c) is a very thorough explanation on how to set up virtual environments within Anaconda.

## Requirements:
**[TO COME]** Provide brief walkthrough of how to use requirements.txt files and then conda or pip install the remaining files.

For any packages not distributed under Anaconda, e.g., the Yahoo Finance package fix, you can do the following in your virtual environment:  ``pip install [name of package]``.
